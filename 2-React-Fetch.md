# Client

## React + fetch

**Goal:** Build a client server, separate from the Node-SQL API server. The client server will run **React** and interact with the API using **fetch**. 

Use Facebook's `create-react-app` to teach React without worrying about the build tools up-front. 

Tools:

* `create-react-app`
* fetch

(Note: most of the "More" section is focused on _more React_ stuff, like Redux, Webpack, and styling).
