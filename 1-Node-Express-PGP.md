## DEV NOTES

**Restart server after changes to QueryFile**

Changing a `.sql` file doesn't restart the server and reload the changes: `new QueryFile` will not re-instantiate. Restart server to instantiate new QueryFile after changing a `.sql` file.

**Errors and exceptions**

In the `catch` clause of a db query, the base err object will appear in console as a stack trace but sometimes not in thre response. For response text, pg-promise errors from queryFile show in `err.message`.

Errors within queryfiles themselves are also possible.

```javascript
if (err instanceof db.$config.pgp.errors.QueryFileError) {             
	console.log('query file error', err);                                
}                                                                      
```

**Delete route**

For DELETE I arbitrarily decided to send the deleted resource in the response: using `RETURNING *` in the sql statement. using `db.one` query in the controller, and status code of 200 (instead of 204).

**JSON notes**

Postgres JSON datatype: Postgres validates json, but there is no native schema validation support for nested json fields and datatypes. Relating JSON data is also problematic. Lesson-wise, this could lead into the topic of relations -- "if you think you need a JSON column, or an array, make a second table instead" -- and maybe some talk about "anti-patterns" using json in a relational db.

#### Misc

Validation: only way to protect against empty strings is with CHECK

```sql
title VARCHAR NOT NULL CHECK (title <> '')
```

Run create db file in bash

```
$ psql -f db/create_db.sql
```

Run schema file in bash

```
$ psql books_app_api -f models/books/schema.sql
```

NOTEWORTHY ERRORS:

```
error: syntax error at or near "$"
```

If you forgot to supply an object to a 'create' or 'update' query, the QueryFile will kick up this error. It's as if it's trying to read SQL as opposed to pg-promise's named parameters syntax.

Don't do this on a create route:

Do do this instead  (include the `req.body` object as data ):
